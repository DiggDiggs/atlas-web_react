# React Official Website

## Getting started with React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

## React Overview
React follows a component-based architecture where UIs are composed of reusable components. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance by minimizing DOM updates.

## create-react-app
create-react-app is a command-line tool that sets up a new React project with a pre-configured development environment. It helps you get started quickly with React without the need for manual configuration.

## React Developer Tools
React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug React components in Chrome and Firefox browsers. It provides insights into component hierarchy, props, and state, helping you diagnose issues more effectively.

## What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features, including JSX syntax, in your code. It transforms your modern JavaScript code into backward-compatible versions that can run in older browsers.

## Enzyme
Enzyme is a testing utility for React applications developed by Airbnb. It provides a set of APIs for testing React components, including shallow rendering, full DOM rendering, and static rendering.
